# Weather Data Storage with Python

## Overview

The "Weather Data Storage with Python" project is designed to automate the process of fetching real-time weather data for a list of cities using the WeatherStack API and storing it in a MySQL database. This README guide will help you set up, run, and contribute to this project effectively.

## Key Features

- **Data Fetching**: The project fetches current weather data for multiple cities from the WeatherStack API, providing real-time information for a range of locations.

- **Database Integration**: Weather data, including temperature, pressure, humidity, and date/time, is stored in a MySQL database, making it accessible for various applications.

- **Error Handling**: The script gracefully handles cases where data is not available for a specific city, ensuring the stability of the data collection process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. **Python**: Python is required for running the script. If not already installed, you can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Python Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
